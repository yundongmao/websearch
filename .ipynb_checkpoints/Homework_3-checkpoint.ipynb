    "<b>Due date</b>: 11pm, Sunday April 15\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Submission method</b>: see LMS\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Submission materials</b>: completed copy of this iPython notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Late submissions</b>: -20% per day\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Marks</b>: 5% of mark for class\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Overview</b>: In this homework, you'll be adapting a POS tagger to Twitter data, starting from a tagger trained on Penn Treebank. You will also use prior information on the Twitter tagset to obtain better performance. Finally, you will also analyse your results in a more fine-grained way. For extra credits, you will implement the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Materials</b>: See the main class LMS page for information on the basic setup required for this class, including an iPython notebook viewer and the python packages NLTK, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Gensim. In particular, if you are not using a lab computer which already has it installed, we recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages; if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Extra credit</b>: Each homework has a task which is optional with respect to getting full marks on the assignment, but that can be used to offset any points lost on this or any other homework assignment (but not the final project or the exam). We recommend you skip over this step on your first pass, and come back if you have time: the amount of effort required to receive full marks (1 point) on an extra credit question will be substantially more than earning the same amount of credit on other parts of the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Updates</b>: Any major changes to the assignment will be announced via LMS. Minor changes and clarifications will be announced in the forum on LMS, we recommend you check the forum regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic Misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourge you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the Universityâ€™s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place.\n"

    "<b>Instructions</b>: you first task is to preprocess the data. We will use two datasets for training: 1) the Penn Treebank sample used in the workshops and 2) the Twitter samples data you used in Homework 1. In order to adapt the tagger to the Twitter data we need to built a *joint* vocabulary containing all the word types in PTB and the twitter_samples corpora. So, in addition to preprocessing, your code should also build this vocabulary. Finally, you should also store the tagset, for reasons that will be clearer later.\n",

    "\n",
    "The vocabulary and the tagset should be stored in Python dictionaries, mapping each word (or tag) to an index (integer). This is similar to what is done in the W6/W7 workshop notebooks. The preprocessed corpora should contain indices only, as in the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the PTB data. You should iterate over all sentences and words, and build the vocabulary and the tagset. Important: make sure you <b>lowercase</b> words before they are added to the dictionary. You should also generate the preprocessed corpus. It should be a list where each element is a tagged sentence, represented as another list of (word, tag) indices (which should correspond to the original words/tags). Print the first preprocessed sentence, the index for the word 'electricity' and the length of the full tagset. (0.5)\n"

    "\n",
    "1) We will perform a bit more of preprocessing in this dataset, besides lowercasing. Specifically, you should replace special tokens with special symbols, as follows:\n",
    "- Username mentions are tokens that start with '@': replace these tokens with 'USER_TOKEN'\n",
    "- Hashtags are tokens that start with '#': replace these with 'HASHTAG_TOKEN'\n",
    "- Retweets are represented as the token 'RT' (or 'rt' if you lowercase first): replace these with 'RETWEET_TOKEN'\n",
    "- URLs are tokens that start with 'https://' or 'http://': replace these with 'URL_TOKEN'\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Do not create a new vocabulary**. Instead, you should update the vocabulary built from PTB with any new words present in this corpus. These should *include* the special tokens defined above but *not* the original un-preprocessed tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to do these steps is by doing 3 passes over the data: preprocess the words first, update the vocabulary and finally convert the corpus into the list format described above. However, it is possible to do all of this in one pass only.\n",

Because the test set should simulate a real-world scenario, where out-of-vocabulary words can appear. Instead, after preprocessing each word, you should check if that word is in the vocabulary. If yes, just replace it with its index, otherwise you should replace it with the index for the `<unk>` token. Remember: you can reuse the code from the workshop for this task.

    "<b>Instructions</b>: here your goal is to improve the tagger using **hard EM**. This question is divided in two parts. Because EM can take a long time to run we will modify our code above to make it faster and also more robust to underflow by making calculations in the log space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to modify the `count` and `viterbi` functions. For `count`, you should return log probabilities for all matrices. For `viterbi`, you should modify the code in the following way:\n",
    "- Calculate scores using log probabilities. Remember that in log space, any products become sums. Also remember to make sure you change the base case as well (not only the inner loop).\n",
    "- You should rewrite the algorithm in vectorised form, in order to make it more efficient. Remember that in Viterbi, the third (inner) `for` loop calculate scores for a single cell, while the second `for` loop calculates scores for a whole column. These operations can be made in parallel, which makes them amenable to vectorisation. Replace the second and third `for` loops in the code with appropriate vector and matrix operations. Remember to do the same to obtain the backpointers. <b>Hint</b>: start by vectorising the inner loop only and check if it is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second task is to implement EM. This can be done without the first step above but bear in mind that it will take much longer to run. Write a function that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1) Tag a corpus using Viterbi and an initial tagger\n",
    "- 2) Train a new tagger using the tagged corpora obtained above.\n",
    "- 3) Repeat both steps above N times.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've done the main homework correctly you should be able to reuse the `count` and `viterbi` functions for this and the code should be very straightforward. You should pretrain your tagger using the steps in the main homework, including the tag adaptation in Part 3. Then, in the inner loop, use the training tweets as your unlabelled corpora. Run 5 iterations of EM and report test accuracy **at every iteration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "EM can take a long time to train, even if you're using the vectorised Viterbi code. If it is too slow in your machine, you're allowed to use a subset of the training tweets for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get full marks, adapt the algorithm in the following manner:\n",
    "- At step 2) above, when training the new tagger, combine **both** the PTB gold data and the tagged training tweets, instead of just using the training tweets.\n",
